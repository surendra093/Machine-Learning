***The dataset "winequality-red.csv" used in "Task_1.py" is dataset spliited into different coloumns. 


1)  Using the data set given we create two datasets datasetA and datasetB
    By running "Task_1.py" we get two arrays  dataset_A and dataset_B which represents datasetA and datasetB

2)  We use the array dataset_A(D1) which we get from Task_1 to implement LOGISTIC REGRESSION
    By running "Task_2.py" we get mean accuracies,precisions and recall for both classifiers using scikit learn and 
    without using scikit learn.

3)  We use the array dataset_B(D2) which we get from Task_1 to implement DECISION TREE
    By running "Task_3.py" we get mean accuracies,precisions and recall for both classifiers using scikit learn and 
    without using scikit learn  and also we get REPORT for each iteration of Cross validation to get results of 
    macro precisions and recalls.
