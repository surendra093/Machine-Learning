1)using the dataset given we create normalized scores of each attribute and split dataset into train and test set.
  By running "Dataset.py" we get matrix with normalized scores of attributes as output.

2)using the train and test data prepared in Dataset.py,we calculate train and test accuracy using implemented 'Neural network' in 'Task_1.py'.
  By running "Task_1.py" we get Train and test accuracy for both specifiacation 1 and 2.

3)using the train and test data prepared in Dataset.py,we calculate train and test accuracy using 'scikit learn' implementation.
  By running "Task_2.py" we get Train and test accuracy for both specifiacation 1 and 2.
